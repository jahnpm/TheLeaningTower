# TheLeaningTower
This game prototype was made in Unity during a gamejam.

## Description
Stack cubes to build the highest tower possible. Definitely sounds easier than it is. Acceleration of cubes needs to be metered carefully, to not only place them accurately, but also prevent them from crashing into each other.

## Gamepad controls
- B: Spawn next cube
- A: Accelerate up
- Left stick: Move forwards/backwards/left/right

## Keyboard
- Mouse right: Spawn next cube
- Mouse left: Accelerate up
- W/S/A/D: Move forwards/backwards/left/right
